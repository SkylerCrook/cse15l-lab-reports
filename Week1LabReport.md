By Skyler Crook

Logging into the ieng6 server can be confusing, whether its your first time or not. This is why I have created this tutorial on how to connect to the server.
## Step 1 - Installing VSCode
Visual Studio Code is a widely used editor with many useful features for programming.

**To install**
* Go to [the official VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Follow the instructions on their website
* Once you have succesfully installed VSCode it should look like this when you open it

## Step 2 - Connecting to ieng6
In order to do work for the CSE 15L labs, you must connect your computer (Through VSCode) to a remote server called ieng6
**Note** If you are using a Windows computer, you must install Git for Windows and use the Git Bash terminal in VSCode

**To connect**
* First, find your [course specific account](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
* Open a Bash terminal in VSCode and type "ssh " followed by your course specific account with "@ieng6.ucsd.edu" appended to the end

**Note** If it is your first time connecting to the ieng6 server, you will recieve a message asking if you are sure that you want to connect. Type "yes" in the terminal
* Type your password when prompted, and your terminal will now be connected to the server

**Note** To disconnect from the server, run the cammand "exit"
* Once you are succesfully connected, your terminal should look like this

## Step 3 - Testing Cammands
To ensure that your computer is properly connected to the ieng6 server, you can test out a variety of cammands

**Some Cammands you can try are**
* cd
* ls
* pwd
* mkdir
* cp
* Here is an example of some cammands running in the terminal

## Congradulations
You now know how to install VSCode, connect to the CSE ieng6 remote server, and run some cammands.
